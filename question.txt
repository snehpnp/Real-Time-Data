1. Describe a specific experience where you used Node.js and Docker/Kubernetes together to scale a high-traffic application.

Answer:
In one of my projects, Smart Algo, an algorithmic trading platform, we needed to handle a high volume of trading data and execute real-time transactions efficiently. We used Node.js for the backend API and Docker to containerize our application, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.

To scale effectively, we deployed the containers using Kubernetes on AWS. Kubernetes allowed us to manage auto-scaling, load balancing, and failover mechanisms efficiently. Hereâ€™s how we handled the scaling process:

Containerization:

We created a Dockerfile defining our Node.js environment and application dependencies.

Used multi-stage builds to keep the final image lightweight.

Orchestration with Kubernetes:

Deployed multiple replicas of the Node.js service using Kubernetes Deployments.

Used Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale up/down based on CPU and memory usage.

Implemented Redis as a caching layer to optimize API responses.

Load Balancing & Traffic Management:

Deployed an NGINX Ingress Controller to manage incoming requests.

Used Kubernetes Services to distribute traffic evenly across pods.

Monitoring & Logging:

Integrated Prometheus & Grafana for real-time monitoring.

Used ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.

Challenges Faced & Resolutions:
âœ… Challenge: High response times due to database load.
ðŸ”¹ Solution: Implemented caching (Redis) and read replicas in the database to distribute load.

âœ… Challenge: Managing stateful sessions in a distributed system.
ðŸ”¹ Solution: Used JWT tokens and session storage in Redis to maintain user authentication.

âœ… Challenge: Deployment downtime during updates.
ðŸ”¹ Solution: Used Rolling Updates in Kubernetes to ensure zero downtime.


2. What challenges did you face, and how did you resolve them? Walk us through your approach to implementing and optimizing a CI/CD pipeline in a GCP or AWS environment.

Answer :I have not directly implemented a CI/CD pipeline yet, but I have a good understanding of the process and have experience following industry best practices. If required, I can set up a pipeline using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins. I am eager to learn and implement automated deployment workflows and infrastructure setup to streamline the development process.
